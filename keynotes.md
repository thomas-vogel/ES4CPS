## Holger Giese -- Challenges for Engineering Smart Cyber-Physical Systems

We currently can observe a transformation of our technical world into a networked technical world where besides the embedded systems with their interaction with the physical world the interconnection of these nodes in the cyber world becomes a reality. This dramatic transformation towards cyber-physical systems raises the question whether our capabilities to design, produce, and operate these future embedded systems are ready to tackle the resulting challenges. In parallel nowadays there is a strong trend to employ artificial intelligence techniques and in particular machine learning to make software behave smart. To support this trend and to unleash their full potential, cyber-physical systems must be able to operate as elements in open, dynamic, and deviating overall structures and to adapt to open and dynamic contexts while being developed, operated, evolved, and governed independently. We name the resulting cyber-physical systems to be smart as they must be self-adaptive at the level of the individual systems and self-organizing at the system of system level to cope with the emergent behavior at that level.

In this presentation we will first discuss the envisioned future scenarios for embedded systems becoming cyber-physical systems with an emphasis on the synergies networking can offer and then characterize which challenges for the design, production, and operation of these systems result. We will then discuss to what extent our current capabilities in particular concerning engineering match these challenges and where substantial improvements for the engineering are crucial. In classical engineering models are used to plan systems upfront to maximize envisioned properties on the one hand and minimize cost on the other hand. When applying the same ideas to software for smart cyber-physical systems, it soon turned out that for these systems often somehow more subtle links between the involved models and the requirements, users, and environment exist.  Self-adaptation and runtime models have been advocated as concepts to covers the demands that result from these links. Lately, both trends have been brought together more thoroughly by the notion of self-aware computing systems. We will review the underlying causes, discuss some our work in this direction, and outline related open challenges and implications for future approaches to engineer such smart cyber-physical systems.

[__Holger Giese__](https://hpi.de/en/giese/staff/prof-dr-holger-giese.html){:target="_blank"} studied technical computer science at the University Siegen. He received his engineering degree with excellence in October 1995. In February 2001, he received a doctorate in Computer Science at the Institute of Computer Science at the University of MÃ¼nster with summa cum laude. Until 2006, he was an assistant professor for object-oriented specification of distributed systems in the Software Engineering Group of the University of Paderborn. Since 2006, he was a Visiting Professor for System Analysis and Modeling at the Hasso Plattner Institute for Software Systems Engineering. He became a Full Professor for System Analysis and Modeling at the Hasso Plattner Institute for Software Systems Engineering in February 2008.

## Mohammad Reza Mousavi -- Conformance Testing as a Tool for Designing Connected Vehicle Functions

Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAV) are taking a central position in the landscape of intelligent mobility and their rigorous verification and validation is one of the main challenges in their public deployment and social acceptance. Conformance testing is a rigorous verification technique that has been widely tried in various critical applications. In this talk, we examin the adaptations and extensions of the notions of conformance and model-based testing techniques that make them suitable for application in the CAV domain. We present how the extended techniques can be used in the design of connected vehicle functions and verify various design decisions.

[__Mohammad Reza Mousavi__](https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/informatics/people/mohammad-mousavi){:target="_blank"} is a professor of Data-Oriented Software Engineering at University of Leicester, UK. Prior to that, he was professor of Computer Systems Engineering at Halmstad University, Sweden, assistant and associate professor of Computer Science (2005-2013) at TU Eindhoven, and postdoctoral researcher (2006-2007) at Reykjavik University, Iceland. His research interests are in formal semantics and verification and his main current research area is in model-based testing, particularly applied to software product lines and cyber-physical systems.
